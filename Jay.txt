Therefore I would not have look for another job right now. 
I feel like I am a good scholarship candidate because I havenâ€™t had many learning opportunities in the US and I really want to thrive here as long as I can to provide for my family.
 I want to complete my bachelor degree as soon as possible so I can get a good job so my financial condition becomes good.
 In the free time I watch games like cricket, soccer. And I summer I play cricket, volleyball in weekend. 
Higher education will have a great influence on my own life because it will give me the education and the skills I need to become successful.
